{\large \bf Lab Exercise: The rejection method of generating samples [sampling]} \\
\cltag\ \\
Last compiled: \today
\end{spacing}

%------------------------

\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item The purpose of this exercise is to understand one particular method of generating samples from an arbitrary probability distribution. The sampling method, known as the {\em rejection method}, was introduced by \citet{vonNeumann1951} and is also discussed in Section 2.3.2 of \citet{Tarantola2005}. An example of its application can be found in \citet{SilwalTape2016} for the case of a three-dimensional model parameter space defining the orientation of an earthquake source mechanism.

We use the rejection method to generate samples of an arbitrary distribution. As far as I know, there is no such function in Python to do this. (Let me know if you find one!)

\item A secondary purpose is to become familiar with using custom functions in Python. These are functions that are defined by you within a Python script, such as

\verb+ def p(x): ( A1*np.exp(-(x-x1)**2/(2*sig1**2)) );+

in our lab. These functions can be useful for writing down code that is as close to the mathematics as possible, such as
%
\begin{equation}
p(x) = A_1\,e^{-(x-x_1)^2/(2\sigma_1^2)}
\end{equation}

\item We will also get some practice plotting 2D functions in Python.

\item We will be starting with the template notebook \verb+lab_sampling.ipynb+.

%\item Make a copy of the template script:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%cp lab_sampling_template.m lab_sampling.m
%\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Review \verb+lab_linefit.ipynb+. What does the Numpy function \verb+np.random.random()+ do? What would a histogram look like for values generated using this function?

\vertgap

\item Write a command to return a set of $n$ numbers that are uniformly distributed on the interval $[a,b]$.

\vertgap

\item The notebook calls the custom function \verb+plot_histo+ from \verb+lib_geos.ipynb+. What does \verb+plot_histo+ do?

\vertgap

\item Run the notebook to generate the figure in \refFig{fig}. The script will generate samples of a specified function that we can think of as a probability density function.

\item Read the code and determine what is being plotted in each subplot of \refFig{fig}. \\
Define $A = \max(p(x))$.

\item Explain the pattern in \refFig{fig}c and how it occurs. 

Set \verb+iannot = 1+ to annoate \refFig{fig}a to help your understanding.

What fraction of $p(x_i)/A$ are $<$0.05?

What fraction of $p(x_i)/A$ are $>$0.95?

\vertgap

\item There is a plot containing four subplots. Make sure you understand the relationships among the four subplots. (Note that only the fourth subplot is new.)

\vertgap

\item Explain how a sample ``makes it'' into the final set of accepted samples (\refFig{fig}e).

Why is a low value, $p(x_i)/A < 0.05$, generally going to be rejected?

Why is a high value, $p(x_i)/A > 0.95$, generally going to be kept?

\vertgap

\item What fraction of samples were kept for your run?
% 18825/100000  = 0.188 samples kept

\vertgap

\item Integrate $p(x)/A$ numerically to get the area under the curve. \\
Hint: What is \verb+dx+? See the Appendix in \verb+hw_ch1.pdf+.

\vertgap

\item Divide this number by \verb+xmax - xmin+, which represents the area under the curve for the (normalized) uniform distribution. How does this result compare with the fraction of samples that were kept?

\vertgap

\item Now try a more interesting function by changing \verb+ifun=2+ in the 2nd cell block to see the sum of two Gaussians.

What fraction of samples were kept for your run?

What is $\int p(x)/A \, dx$?

\end{enumerate}

%------------------------

\subsection*{Practice}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Now that you've used a function for one variable, try writing one for two variables, $f(x,y)$. This will be useful for Problem 1 of the epicenter homework.

In the space at the bottom of \verb+lab_sampling.ipynb+, write a function for 
%
\begin{equation*}
p(x,y) = A\,e^{-(x^2+y^2)},
\end{equation*}
%
then evaluate the function for some $A$ at some input values $(x_i,y_i)$, and check the output $p(x_i,y_i)$ with the direct calculation of $A\,e^{-(x^2+y^2)}$.

\item If your function is properly defined, then you should be able to plot it using the lines in \verb+lab_sampling.ipynb+. Make sure you understand the different ways of plotting this function. Note that you can pass any dimensional array (scalar, vector, matrix, etc) as \verb+x+ and \verb+y+ into \verb+p(x,y)+.
